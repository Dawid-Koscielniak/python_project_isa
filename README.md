Database: Credit Card Approval Prediction (https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction/data)

Main goal stated by my group for this project was to use basic libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib) to analyse this dataset and make conclusions.
Also, there is a simple application which informs, whether client should receive an approval for credit card or not. This decision is made due to conclusions made during analysis.
It is also the first step to get acknowledged with this dataset before utilizing ML tools.

Dataset establishment:	Scrypt loads csv database and merges two tables into one dataset. Also it is preprocessed and needless values are dropped.
